# How to contribute to devSTORE

This repo is a reference and learning resource and everyone is invited to contribute.

There's a general development strategy that's driven by @EduardoPires / @BrunoHBrito, who chooses, or defines criteria for choosing, the issues to include in the codebase, given a bunch of constraints and other guidelines.

## Coding Standards

There are no explicit coding standards so pay attention to the general coding style, that's (mostly) used everywhere.

## Development Process

In order to help manage community contributions and avoid conflicts, there's a [Issues Approved List](https://github.com/desenvolvedor-io/dev-store/issues) so pick one to help us.

That's not too easy to define and there are no clear criteria right now but, probably, changing "a couple" lines of code in one file would not qualify while changing "a bunch" of files would.

We'll all be learning in the process so we'll figure it out somehow.

### General Steps

1. Issues are managed as usual with the regular issues list, just like any other repo.

2. Community members can propose themselves to code an issue.

3. Issues with the **help wanted** label is the best choice for you!

4. Before start coding use the issue to talk with the team and propose your solution.

## Tests

There's not a tests policy in the project at this moment, but it'll be greatly appreciated if you include tests.

## Forks and Branches

All contributions must be submitted as a [Pull Request (PR)](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) so you need to [fork this repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) on your GitHub account.

## DISCLAIMER - This is not a PRODUCTION-READY TEMPLATE for microservices
Since this is a learning resource, some design decisions have favored simplicity to convey a pattern, over production-grade robustness.

## Suggestions

We hope this helps us all to work better and avoid some of the problems/frustrations of working in such a large community.

We'd also appreciate any comments or ideas to improve this.
